test3",ACCEPT,yes,yes,"Here I pursue a linguistic reconstruction of the earliest stages of grammar, following a precise syntactic theory. This reconstruction arrives at the initial stages of grammar which are in consort with crosslinguistic variation attested in the expression of various syntactic phenomena, including transitivity and tense marking. Interestingly, in making an argument for the antiquity of language, Dediu & Levinson (2013, p. 11) express their hope “that some combinations of structural features will prove so conservative that they will allow deep reconstruction.” I propose that the earliest stages of syntax as reconstructed here provide just such a conservative platform from which all the subsequent variation could arise, and which could have been commanded also by our cousins and the common ancestor. The reconstruction is at the right level of granularity to exclude some hypotheses regarding the hominin timeline, and to support others. It leads to specific and testable hypotheses which can be explored in e.g. anthropology, neuroscience, and genetics."
